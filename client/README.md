# Can you kanji?

### Created by Rachael H & Jezinho  


### A description of the project  
A web app that allows users to choose which kanji they wish to learn, and then record their progress. There will possibly be gamified learning activities to support practice.

### The overall problem domain and how the project solves those problems  
Learning Japanese is difficult because as well as different words, there are three different ways to express these words in writing. The most difficult is kanjis, so this is a web app to help choose and record which kanjis you are learning, and what your progress is. Matching an image to a word is a good way to practise, but this requires physical resources - or digital ones!

### Semantic versioning, beginning with version 1.0.0 and incremented as changes are made
